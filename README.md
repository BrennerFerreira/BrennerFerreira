# Hi, I'm Brenner Ferreira
## About me
I graduated in Physics and I am passionate about the web and mobile development field. I studied at Espirito Santo State University and, at the moment, I work as a permanent Physics teacher, but I am looking to change my career. I am enrolled in the Business Intelligence & Analytics specialization at Pontifícia Universidade Católica, in the state of Minas Gerais. 

## Personal Projects
I have developed mobile apps using Dart, with the Flutter framework, and developed web projects with Javascript (full stack) and Go (back end).

### Flutter
- [Pay Flow](https://github.com/BrennerFerreira/pay_flow)
- [Finnancer](https://github.com/BrennerFerreira/personal_expenses_app)
- [To Do List App](https://github.com/BrennerFerreira/to_do_list_app_flutter)

### Typescript
- [Express API](https://github.com/BrennerFerreira/typescript_express_api)

## Open for Work
I am searching for jobs in web development (front end, back end and full stack) and mobile development.
