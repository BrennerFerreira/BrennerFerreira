# Hi, I'm Brenner Ferreira
## About me
I graduated in Physics and I am passionate about the web and mobile development field. I studied at Espirito Santo State University and, at the moment, I work as a permanent Physics teacher, but I am looking to change my career. I am enrolled in the Business Intelligence & Analytics specialization at Pontifícia Universidade Católica, in the state of Minas Gerais. I have been studying programming for over a year, focusing on mobile and web development.

## Personal Projects
I have developed mobile apps using Dart, with the Flutter framework, and developed web projects with Javascript and Typescript (full stack).
